  I'm currently looking for my first job experience in the web development market. I'd like to be part of an organization that lets me expand my knowledge about the web and it's vast world of technologies.
  <br />
  Besides of being in a need for a work, another reason for which I'd like to be part of a team is that I want to get to know different developers and learn from them, consequently making me grow as developer.
  <br />
  I consider myself an easy person to deal with, always open to listen different points of view. If you would like me to be part of your team, I leave a link to my <a href="#">resume</a>.</p>
